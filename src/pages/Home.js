                <p>I find myself not interest in web dev since beginning of my computer science journey but the more I learn about database wheter it's SQL or NoSQL, I find myself be abloe to drive into the subject excitingly. I lead myself to self taught data visualzation and data cleaning since my program doesn't have specific course for me</p>
                <p>It was confusing, tiring and fustrating I'll honest, but I trust to process and not giving up on myself and keep learning new stuff.</p>
